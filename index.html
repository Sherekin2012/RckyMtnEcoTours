                 <h2>Why Eco-Tourism?</h2><p>
                    <p>Now more than ever, travelers are aware of their environmental impact and the measures they can take to reduce it. That’s why ecotourism, wherever we choose to go, can and should be central to our travel plans. If you’re looking for the most sustainable places to visit in the United States, here’s our pick.</p>
                    <p>Ecotourism provides a means of accessing the world’s most remarkable places without destroying what makes them so special in the first place. By way of conservation, alternative energy, sustainable practices, awareness and environmentally sound methods, you’re now free to take that vacation with a clear conscience.</p>
                    <p>
                 
                 
                        Traveling in Colorado as an ecotourist is hardly a challenge. In a region where diverse landscapes are ubiquitous, residents are understandably keen to preserve the state’s natural beauty. Many Colorado attractions and lodgings are dedicated to the LEED Certification Program, with the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver being the first gold-certified museum in the nation. Element Denver Park Meadows has implemented energy conservation and recycling practices, while local tourism companies offer eco-friendly adventure activities – whether that means rafting through river canyons or exploring Rocky Mountain National Park.</p>
